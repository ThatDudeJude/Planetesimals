## Contributor Guide
### Making Changes and Fixing Issues
You can send a request to be added as a **collaborator** with write access and other permissions. If otherwise, you can still proceed as a contributor with the following steps.

1. If not a collaborator, fork this repository first, then clone the project. Then [install and run](README.md#installation-and-running) the project in your local computer as specified in the README. Note: The **git** version control tool is highly recommended for cloning and managing changes locally. 

2. Create a working branch i.e using ``git checkout -b your_name_[change/issue]`` and make your changes within it. Make sure to follow the correct file structure established in the project if adding any files.
3. Once you are satisfied with the changes made or issue fixed, you can add your changes e.g using ``git add .`` and commit them by adding a commit message that highlights your changes, e.g 
   ```
   git commit -m "Made changes to [this feature, line in file etc.] to improve/correct/update the [specific styling, functionality etc.] by [changes made or issue fixed]"
   ```
    Indicate if additional files have been created.

4. Push your changes i.e ``git push -u origin [your_new_branch]``.
5. Finally you can make a pull request as a contributor [with no write access](#make-a-pull-request-with-no-write-access) or [with write access](#make-a-pull-request-with-write-access).
