                    Microbes are easily the most basic of all organisms. Their simplicity <a href="https://www.livescience.com/1477-invisible-world-microbes.html">

                    For instance, there are <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-many-bacteria-cells-outnumber-human-cells-microbiome-science">trillions of microbes</a> 
                    living in the average human body that facilitate normal body functions.

                    Granted the simplicity and popularity of microbes, some invisible critters showcase surprisingly superior self-preservation instincts. 
                    These microbes, known as <b>extremophiles</b>, exhibit extraordinary adaptation to extreme environments.

                    Tardigrades are found <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/t/tardigrades-water-bears/">virtually everywhere</a>. In boiling water.
                    In freezing temperatures. In deserts and on mountains. They’ve even been on the
                    moon. They can dive to the deepest ocean trenches and even go decades without food and water.
                    But they much prefer living on wet mosses and lichens, thus earning them the name moss piglets.

                    Tardigrades often withstand inhospitable conditions many animals
                    wouldn’t. They can weather temperature drops of up to -272&deg; Celsius and highs
                    of up to 150&deg; Celsius. Their barrel-shaped bodies can take six times the
                    crushing pressure at the bottom of any ocean. They have even <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-49265125">been to outer space</a> and borne the extreme radiation found there.

                <p class="grid-90 push-5">
                    This hardiness is partly due to a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrades-dna-damage-radiation-death#:~:text=A%20'fluffy%20cloud'%20of%20protein,which%20would%20kill%20a%20human.">DNA protecting mechanism</a>
                    facilitated by a protein in their bodies called a “Damage suppressor”, 
                    a.k.a the Dsup. This protein, only found in tardigrades, keeps off harmful
                    radiation from damaging their DNA.

                <p class="grid-90 push-5">
                    Tardigrade survival is also aided by <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/exploringourfluidearth/biological/what-alive/properties-life/weird-science-cryptobiosis">cryptobiosis</a>.
                    This is a state of dormancy and inactivity triggered by uncomfortably
                    dry conditions.&nbsp; They achieve this state by curling up into a ball known as a tun, a process involving squeezing out all
                    the water from their bodies. </p>

                <p class="grid-90 push-5">

                    While in cryptobiosis, tardigrades can wait for conditions to
                    improve. When it does, they uncurl themselves and carry on as before.

                    looked into three possible extinction scenarios. These were

                    phenomena. Naturally, such events would generate so much heat on the Earth that
                    all oceans would dry and all water vapor would disappear from the Earth’s atmosphere.

                        Scientific evidence shows that about 65 million years past, a
                    large asteroid struck the Earth and triggered a mass extinction. Presently, there are                    
                    fifteen similar objects orbiting the sun. When given enough mass a similar
                    event could be initiated. An earth-bound hit would eventually boil all the oceans.

                    highly energetic event known as a supernova. This event releases radiation with
                    the highest energies at light-speed. If that energy were to dry up the Earth’s
                    oceans, a massive star would have to explode about 0.41 light-years away (about&nbsp; 3.88 &#xd7; 10<sup>12</sup> km) away.

                         go supernova is only about 147 light-years  (1.4 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup> km) away.

                    radiation characterized by massive amounts of energy. They would have to originate from a
                    distance of about 45 light-years  (4.3 &#xd7; 10<sup>14</sup> km) for them to wipe out all the
