                    <li>Tardigrade hardiness borders on “indestructible” having survived in environments most lifeforms

                    <li>
                        To further prove this, some researchers have shed light on possible

                    Microbes are easily the most basic of all organisms. Their simplicity <a href="https://www.livescience.com/1477-invisible-world-microbes.html"> 
                    enables their survival almost anywhere on Earth </a>. This makes them capable of providing crucial support mechanisms for all lifeforms. For instance, there are
                    <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-many-bacteria-cells-outnumber-human-cells-microbiome-science">trillions of microbes</a> living in the average human body that support normal body functions.
                    However, this pervasiveness can also disrupt life, causing disease and death.

                <p class="grid-90 push-5">
                    Granted the simplicity and popularity of microbes, some invisible critters showcase surprisingly superior self-preservation instincts. 
                    These microbes, known as extremophiles, exhibit extraordinary adaptation to extreme environments.

                <p class="grid-90 push-5">
                    However, scientific research shows that one critter is outstandingly worthy of the survivor crown: the mighty tardigrade.

                    In freezing temperatures. In deserts and on mountains. They’ve even been on the
                    moon. They can go decades without food and water and dive to the deepest ocean

                    Tardigrades often withstand inhospitable conditions most animals
                    wouldn’t. They can weather temperature drops of up to -272&deg; Celsius and highs
                    of up to 150&deg; Celsius. Their barrel-shaped bodies can take six times the
                    crushing pressure at the bottom of any ocean. They have even <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-49265125">been to outer space</a> and borne the extreme radiation found there.

                <p class="grid-90 push-5">
                    This hardiness is partly due to a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrades-dna-damage-radiation-death#:~:text=A%20'fluffy%20cloud'%20of%20protein,which%20would%20kill%20a%20human.">DNA protecting mechanism</a>
                    facilitated by a protein in their bodies called a “Damage suppressor”, 
                    a.k.a the Dsup. This protein, only found in tardigrades, keeps off harmful
                    radiation from damaging their DNA.

                <p class="grid-90 push-5">
                    Tardigrade survival is also aided by <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/exploringourfluidearth/biological/what-alive/properties-life/weird-science-cryptobiosis">cryptobiosis</a>.
                    This is a state of dormancy and inactivity triggered by uncomfortably
                    dry conditions.&nbsp; They achieve this state by curling up into a ball known as a tun, a process involving squeezing out all
                    the water from their bodies. </p>

                    While in cryptobiosis, they can wait for conditions to
                    improve. When they do, they uncurl themselves and carry on as before.

                    To test just how robust tardigrades can be, some <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-07-tardigrades-survivors-earth.html">researchers</a>
                    looked into three possible extinction scenarios. These were
                    apocalyptic&hyphen;scale doomsday events triggered by possible astrophysical
                    phenomena. Naturally, such events would generate so much heat on the Earth that
                    all oceans would dry and all water vapor would disappear from the Earth’s atmosphere.

                    extinctions on Earth, we wanted to know if there are any astrophysical events

                    The three possible extinction events considered are set in motion by a large
                    impacting asteroid, a supernova, and gamma-ray bursts.&nbsp; But why these events exactly?

                        Scientific evidence shows that about 65 million years past, a
                    large asteroid struck the Earth and triggered a mass extinction. Presently, there are                    
                    fifteen similar objects orbiting the sun. Given enough mass to initiate a similar
                    event, an Earth-bound hit would eventually boil all the oceans. Luckily, none of the monitored
                    objects are on a collission course with the Earth at the moment.

                        When a massive star has reached its death, it explodes in a
                    highly energetic event known as a supernova. This event releases radiation with
                    the highest energies at light-speed. If that energy were to dry up the Earth’s
                    oceans, a massive star would have to explode about 0.41 light-years away (about&nbsp; 3.88 &#xd7; 10<sup>12</sup> km) away.

                            Fortunately, Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our Sun, is
                    not massive enough to set off a supernova. The nearest massive star likely to
                    go supernova is only about 147 light-years  (1.4 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup> km) away.

                        Very energetic supernova events release what are called
                    gamma-ray bursts. These bursts involve a type of radiation known as gamma
                    radiation characterized by massive amounts of energy. They would have to originate from a
                    distance of about 45 light-years  (4.3 &#xd7; 10<sup>14</sup> km) for them to wipe out all the
                    oceans from the Earth’s surface.&nbsp;
